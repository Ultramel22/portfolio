                <h1>a little bit about me...</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm a graphic designer for a small signage company based in Cape Town. <br/>
                    Shy at first, Im very reserved but once I’m familiar with my surroundings and the people around me, I become a big enthusiastic ball of energy.
                    I’m passionate about creating, problem solving, doing more than just my job, fixing that annoying computer bug (no more need for Mr. IT guy) and bottomless cups of coffee. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    I have a love for creating elements for the web and enjoy the control of coding a site from scratch.
                    I’m a hard worker, invest all of myself in whatever I do and believe that a task should be done properly or should not be done at all (half assed is not my style).
                    Being a stickler for efficiency & effective workflow I am able to easily identify areas that require improvement, thus creating solutions which effectively solve the problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My downtime consists of creating art (drawing/illustrating/lettering) using traditional mediums and learning new skills. 
                    I enjoy challenges and the process one takes to solve them, once conquered, im ready to take on the next one. 
                </p>
